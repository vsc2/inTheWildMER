    "# Data Summary 2 - Processed Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous summary, I had presented the collected data from various sources. This time, I present the data which I have organized and to some extent preprocessed and operationalized (made usable by the algorithms).\n",
    "\n",
    "To remind a bit what the project is about, here is a short summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the project is to label listening events, taking into consideration the listener's properties, the context of the listening event, the track's content and the track's context. To do this, two approaches will be tested: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1st approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first approach, I will feed a neural network with feature vectors and a mask hiding some of the values. The neural network should then return the hidden (missing) values. This requires that it is fed with well structured vectors that contain the whole data.\n",
    "The target values will not only be the emotional labels, but rather the whole vector, such that it is able to classify the emotion of a musical event, but also return information on the listener, the music content or other information based on the existing emotional or not emotional data. \n",
    "In the end, the created NN will be able to fill in the whole dataset of emotionally labeled listening events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2nd approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a graph, where the nodes represent music listening events and the vertices are vectors describing the similarity relationship between the events at different levels, such as similarity based on listeners' properties and context, a song's content and context, etc. By finding the correct mathematical transformation based on the similarity of a track to it's neighbours, the neighbours update and improve the music events' missing values. In other words, it will use Graph-Based Semi-supervised Learning to infer the missing values and thus create a dataset of emotionally labeled listening events.\n",

    "# 1) DATA\n",
    "In the following sections I will describe the data, which has now been preprocessed and is almost ready to be used. The missing parts are the separation into training and test sets and also a deeper analysis of each feature. The preprocessing steps that have been taken do not infringe the training-testing separation, except where explicitly described - and recalculation will be done for a clean separation between training and testing preprocessing.The main difference in regards to the first notebook regarding the datasets is that the data is now operationalized and ready to use (with only a very few exceptions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the presentation of the datasets, I have separated everything into the following categories: first, just a list of the track's metadata, which are a collection of the id's within the different sources for easy merging. Secondly follows the features of the tracks' content, also followed by data relating to the tracks' context. In fourth place comes a collection of user data, and finally a list of all the events which will be the actual samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data that is described in the following sections is derived from the list of sources described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the [AudioDB](https://www.theaudiodb.com) API, important information was crawled that helped in merging the different datasets, as well as prividing some few features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [LFM](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-2b/) dataset, or more specifically, the RecSys'22 subset of the LFM-2b dataset contains information and metadata on the tracks, user listening events, user information and user created tags and genres. This data was originally retrieved from the Last.FM music platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [LJ2M dataset](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6890172) (download not available anymore) is a collection of blog posts in the LiveJournal platform, where users create posts, label it with an emotional keyword and associate a song to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The list of Lyrics was created using the [Genius](https://genius.com/) API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Million Music Tweet Dataset (MMTD)](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/MMTD/) is composed of some ID information, the Tweeting events representing a music listening event (including user id, location and other info) as well as a more detailed description on the different locations and country data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [Spotify Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge) contains, as the name says, a million playlists. The extracted info was the playlist's name, the number of followers, the total number of tracks, and a list of the songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is information extracted from the [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/) API. It contains a big deal of features, such as danceability, energy, key, tempo and valence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This list of spotify playlists by [Eva Zangerle](https://evazangerle.at/publication/pichl-ijmdem-2017/pichl-ijmdem-2017.pdf) contains also some information on spotify playlists, however it includes user id's as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly, there are two other sources that have not finished the crawling process, as they take long due to the maximum allowed items collected per day from the respective services. If they are crawled sucessfully, they will be added in the future, within the scope of the \"Bachelorarbeit\".  These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crawled Tweets using the Twitter API for the keywords \"[Artist] - [Track]\".\n",
    "- Youtube comments - using the Google Api.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset mentioned in a previous submission will not be included since it only narroly overlaps with the rest of the data, thus probably not bringing any valuable information:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The [MuMu](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/mumuhttps://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/mumu) dataset contains information about amazon album purchases, such as \"bought together\" data, reviews and genre labeling."

Numbers have been removed and any letters that repeat more than 3 times have been reduced to 2 subsequent appearences(\"Pleeeeease\" --> \"Pleease\") in order to reduce somewhat such stylistic figures. The features extracted from the text will be described in the explanation of the DataFrame after this one.\n",

They refer to features extracted using the song's content and, even though we do not know how they were computed, they are easily accessible in the wild. They contain a lot of interesting information, such as energy, key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness etc., which intuitively, seem to be relevant to influence the emotion of the listener.\n",

    "- describe the lyrics as the mean value of their words within an embedding ([GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) embedding pretrained using Twitter); \n",
    "- Use tools such as [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/), [VADER](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html), [pysentimiento](https://github.com/pysentimiento/pysentimiento), [ANEW](https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/teaching/courses/2009-08UVM-300/docs/others/everything/bradley1999a.pdf) word lexicon\n",

    "The text extraction procedure seen in this section has been applied to all the NLP feature extraction processes in this notebook, and thus the following explanation should be valid every time that in the following notebook I refer to \"NLP features\".\n",
    "- The embedding values are the mean of the embedding values of all the words in the text. If a word was not in the dictionary, it was ignored. If no words were found, the vector is filled with \"NaN\". The text was set to lower case, stopwords and numbers were removed before preprocessing, however words were not lemmatized or stemmed in any way.\n",
    "- The emotional features are the following:\n",
    "- TextBlob provides a value for polarity [-1 to 1] and subjectivity [0 to 1].\n",
    "- VADER provides a value for the positive, neutral, negative and the compound sentiment in the full sentence.\n",
    "- Pysentimento's emotional analyzer provides a probability of the text containing the emotion anger, surpise, fear, disgust, joy, sadness or \"others\".\n",
    "- Using the ANEW lexicon, the Valence, Arousal and Dominance values for each of the words of the text present in the lexicon were collected. Their mean and the 0 to 100's percentiles of the distribution, in steps of 10, should more or less describe the emotional distribution os a sentence.\n",

    "#### Track Similarity based on co-occurence in playlists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a very interesting dataset: it is a matrix of Tracks x Tracks (lines x columns), where each cell contains a list (separated by \"\\t\") of the playlists that the track in the columns co-occures with the track in the lines. In the example below, we see that the track with lfm_id=23570 does not share any playlist with track lfm_id=60189 indicating small similarity between both, while track lfm_id=189560 and track lfm_id=1675423 are in playlists \"Starred\" and \"Last.fm Recommendations\", indicating a small but not null similarity. \n",
    "The strenght of such a similarity will need to be further computed into numerical values, and there are several possibilities to do so:\n",
    "- simply count the number of playlists: This gives a raw number of the counts of playlists in which two tracks co-occur. There is however more information to be extracted here.\n",
    "- Weight the counting by the inverse count of the number of songs in that playlist. I.e.: we see that \"Starred\" occurs quite often in these 3 rows, which seems to mean that maybe a lot of songs are in a playlist called \"Starred\" (not always the same playlist, but this is not extractable from the original dataset). In this case, co-occuring in the \"Starred\" should not weight as much as being in the same playlist called \"When I am feeling lonely\", which only contains a hand full of songs. Songs that occur in the latter playlist should be judged to be more similar than in \"Starred\".\n",
    "- The name of the playlist is also relevant! : As in the above example, \"When I am feeling lonely\" is a name of the playlist that not only servers as an identifyer, but also contains some information. One can use several methods to judge the emotional or semantic content of the name, and then weight the counting using such additional information, resulting in similarities between songs that are for example based on emotion: i.e. in terms of loneliness of the listener's description, two songs show a high degree of similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting similarity matrices can then be used in the following way for the algorithms:\n",
    "- Using Latent Semantic Analysis(LSA) or other algorithms, one can reduce the dimensionality of the matrix, thus resulting in a vector describing it's position within an embedding. This can then be added to the feature vector that goes into the Neural Network.\n",
    "- A matrix with songs as lines and columns serves as an adjancy matrix in a graph, describing the paths/similarities between track-nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that this method based on co-occurrence in the domain of spotify playlists can be extended to other domains, such as festival line-ups and other settings where tracks or artists co-occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cells are:\n",
    "- An example of the co-occurrence matrix using the Spotify Playlist (by Eva Zangerle) dataset, with each cell being a list of the playlist names.\n",
    "- An example of the co-occurrence matrix using the Spofity Million Paylist Dataset (SMPD), which contains a list of playlist's ID's in the cell.\n",
    "- The same co-occurrence matrix as above, however only with the total counts, thus describing how this matrix can be turned into numerical values that then allow for the computation of similarity between songs.\n",
    "- Additional information that can be used for playlist weighing, for example using the number of followers, the number of total tracks (only counting those that are in our dataset) and the playlist names.\n",
    "- The original size of the playlists, as presented by the original authors of the dataset, with tracks that are and are not present in our dataset."

    "#### Artist / Album co-occurrence:\n",
    "As shortly mentioned in the above section, co-occurrence can be measured at different levels. Two such levels are whether tracks are played by the same artist or whether they are in the same album. This is, because there is a chance that there is some similarity between songs of the same artist/album. Just as the co-occurence matrices above, these can be useful for adjancy matrices in graphs or using LSA reduced to a meaningful amount of dimensions, to use within a song's feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, in the following tables we can see the matrix where lines and columns are both tracks, and the cell is 0 if there is no link between them, and 1 if there is. Below that, we shortly compute the sum of each line, to show that, even though the matrix is super sparse, nevertheless, there are links between tracks.\n",

Below is the same information, however displayed such that each of the songs has a feature vector, where each feature is the count (user-given relevance) for a given genre. in total there are >1000 genres (and thus features). This can be used as a feature vector in itself, or the dimensionality can be reduced in different ways."

    "Emotions make part of the user context of the listening event because they are features respective to the user, and at the same time they may vary depending on the event. However, we can extract the emotional spectrum related to a specific song, which would then describe context features of the that track. LiveJournal provides such information, where users provided the emotion that they experienced when writing of an event, and then relate a song to that text and emotion. That information is captured in the following events, which show the emotion, the text, the user ID, and the track - artist."

It is not perfect, but below we can see that for the emotions \"happy\", \"sad\", \"angry\" and \"amused\" show a more interesting relationship than only that of valence and arousal: happy and amused are very similar, however they both are distinct from sad and angry, and sad and angry are actually distinct from one another."

During the filtering of the songs, to see which would go into the intersection or not, I also counted for each user how many where part of the final intersection (\"in\"), how many were \"out\". Together they sum up to the \"total\". \"Coverage\" is \"in\"/\"total\", and provides some confidence about how well the user is going to be represented within the existing dataset. The age, which was a numeric value, has been changed to a one-hot vector. The reason is that this vector means \"with 100% certainty, the user was this age\". Later, when infering, the algorithm might return different ages, with different condifences. Take into consideration, -1 represents that the information is not provided, and some ages, such as 0-10 or >100 might, in some cases, mean that the user provided a fake age.\n",

    "#### LJ2M\n",
    "In the LJ2M dataset there are a lot of listeners that did not listen more than just a handfull of tracks. This results in an interaction matrix that is not that useful, and also is so sparce that it does not fit in the RAM. Therefore, the interaction matrix only considers users that listened to 5 or more tracks, while the others will be considered as missing values. This has the additional benefit that we do not judge listeners based only on one song, which might have too big of an influence in the results."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The most time consuming part is now finished: The data has been cleaned and preprocessed and is now ready to be used. \n",
    "To summarize, since the purpose of this project is to create a dataset of music linstening events labeled with emotion, one needs to find a set of listening events, and through similarity of the track's and listener's properties and context, try to infer the emotional labels from data where one knows the labels to listening events where one does not know the label yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section of the Data chapter, the listening events, containing a user_id, a track_id, a time stamp and some event_specific user context (LJ2M text) were given. These map to the information provided in the other sections of the Data chapter. There we find information about the following things: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Track Content:\n",
    "- Spotify's algorithms process and openly provide some features regarding the song's content, from features such as \"danceability\" to \"energy\" or the musical key.\n",
    "- From the Lyrics, we can extract fearures regarding the semantics and the emotion/sentiment in the text.\n",
    "2. Track Context:\n",
    "- Track co-occurence in a playlist provides similarity measures between tracks, especially if we interpret the name of the playlist\n",
    "- artist and album co-occurence also shows a strong degree of similarity, one can expect\n",
    "- based on event history, two tracks being played within a short period of time can show a high degree of similarity\n",
    "- user-generated genre tags are a almost universal way of labeling tracks\n",
    "- other user-generated tags can provide also other emotional or semantic context to a song\n",
    "- emotional labels given to songs by users can form an emotional spectrum that can be expected for a particular song\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Users:\n",
    "- general location data\n",
    "- metadata about LFM users\n",
    "- LJ2M's user emotional spectrum\n",
    "- LJ2M's text aggregated by users\n",
    "- user profile based on listening habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Future Steps\n",
    "1) The first next step is to separate the data into training and testing, such that from this point on, there is no danger of going against the i.i.d rules. Some of the preprocessing will be recalculated to take this into account. \n",
    "In addition this requires also to think about how to actually design the experiment, in order to make sure that the final evaluation are valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Prototyping and testing out the first models\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Some analysis of the existing features, such as statistical and visual description of the data will be very handy at this point, as this will help interpet and verify the results."
